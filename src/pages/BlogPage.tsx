<Text  fontSize={'xl'}>Life Sciences Data Archive (LSDA)</Text>
<p>Publicly accessible active archive of data from NASA-funded spaceflight, flight analog, and ground-based life sciences research investigations. Basic descriptions of the individual investigations are provided, and data collected from these investigations (when available) are stored in primarily file-based formats (e.g. spreadsheet, text, and image formats). Non-attributable data for many of these investigations can be downloaded directly from the website. However, sensitive or attributable data must be requested via the Data Request Portal. New or updated information is continually added to the archive.</p>

<Text  fontSize={'xl'}>Physical Science Informatics (PSI) Data Repository</Text>
<p>The Physical Science Informatics (PSI) data repository is the archive for physical science experiments performed on the International Space Station (ISS) and Space Transportation System (STS, or space shuttle). The PSI system is accessible and open to the public, and is a resource for researchers to data mine the PSI system and expand upon the valuable research performed by NASA in space, using it as a research tool to further science, while also fulfilling the President’s Open Data Policy.</p>

<Text  fontSize={'xl'}>Materials In Space</Text>
<p>Materials used on the exterior of spacecraft, satellites, and space stations in low-Earth orbit are subjected to many environmental threats that can cause degradation. Space environments affect flight experiments and test the stability and durability of materials and devices in the space environment. The goal of this site is to provide single-point access to the data and analysis from research into materials in space. Data are stored in NASA’s Materials And Processes Technical Information System (MAPTIS).</p>

<Text  fontSize={'xl'}>EarthData</Text>
<p>Earth Science Data from the International Space Station: The NASA Earth Observing System Data and Information System (EOSDIS) provides Earth science data to users from satellite, airborne, and International Space Station (ISS) missions for long-term global observations of the land surface, biosphere, solid Earth, atmosphere, and oceans. This coordinated approach enables an improved understanding of the Earth as an integrated system. Earthdata Search is a tool that enables users to search for and obtain EOSDIS data. Earth science data collected by sensors aboard the ISS is available via Earthdata Search here. NASA’s Earth science data adheres to an open data policy. For more information about EOSDIS, its data, and the missions it supports, visit the Earthdata website.</p>

<Text  fontSize={'xl'}>NASA Task Book</Text>
<p>Task Book: Biological & Physical Sciences Division and Human Research Program is an online database of research projects supported by the Space Biology and Physical Sciences research areas within the Biological & Physical Sciences (BPS) Division of NASA’s Science Mission Directorate, and the Human Research Program in NASA’s Human Exploration and Operations (HEO) Mission Directorate. Research projects within the Translational Research Institute for Space Health (TRISH) are included, beginning with FY2017 projects. The database also includes research projects of the National Space Biomedical Research Institute (NSBRI), all completed by May 2017. Database information includes project descriptions, annual or final research results, Earth benefits and research impacts, and listings of publications resulting from the NASA-funded research. (Formerly the Space Life & Physical Sciences Research & Applications (SLPSRA) Division Task Book, the Space Biology and Physical Sciences programs transferred to the Science Mission Directorate in July 2020.)</p>

<Text  fontSize={'xl'}>NASA’s Open Data Portal</Text>
<p>In answer to the White House mandate to release NASA’s data to the public, the Open Data Portal is a continuously growing catalog of publicly available NASA datasets. Users are invited to innovate with NASA data from multiple categories: aerospace, applied science, earth science, management/operations, and space science. The Developers Portal has documentation on  Application Programming Interface (APIs), code snippets for building apps, visualizations, and more.</p>

<Text  fontSize={'xl'}>PubSpace</Text>
<p>NASA is partnering with the PubMed Central (PMC) repository, hosted by The National Institutes of Health, to provide public access to peer-reviewed papers resulting from NASA-funded research. Beginning with research funded in 2016, all NASA-funded authors and co-authors (both civil servant and non-civil servant) have an Agency requirement to deposit copies of their peer-reviewed scientific publications and associated data into NIH’s NASA publication repository, PubSpace.  You can browse and search for NASA related articles archived in PubSpace.</p>

<Text  fontSize={'xl'}>PubMed</Text>
<p>PubMed® comprises more than 30 million citations for biomedical literature from MEDLINE, life science journals, and online books all aimed at improving health–both globally and personally. Citations may include links to full-text content from PubMed Central and publisher web sites. PubMed was developed and is maintained by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), at the U.S. National Library of Medicine (NLM), located at the National Institutes of Health (NIH).</p>

<Text  fontSize={'xl'}>HICO – NASA Ocean Color Database</Text>
<p>The Hyperspectral Imager for the Coastal Ocean (HICO™) was an imaging spectrometer based on the PHILLS airborne imaging spectrometers. HICO is the first space borne imaging spectrometer designed to sample the coastal ocean. HICO sampled selected coastal regions at 90 m with full spectral coverage (380 to 960 nm sampled at 5.7 nm) and a very high signal-to-noise ratio to resolve the complexity of the coastal ocean. HICO demonstrated coastal products including water clarity, bottom types, bathymetry and on-shore vegetation maps. Each year HICO collected approximately 2000 scenes from around the world.  HICO is no longer hosted on the International Space Station though the data from its mission is archived here.</p>

<Text  fontSize={'xl'}>ASIM Science Data Centre</Text>
<p>The Atmosphere-Space Interactions Monitor (ASIM) is an observatory on the International Space Station (ISS) that measures lightning and bursts of gamma-rays from thunderstorm clouds. The overarching goal is to understand the role of electrified storms in atmospheric dynamics. ASIM is a mission of the European Space Agency ESA’s SciSpace Programme for scientific utilization of the ISS and non-ISS space exploration platforms and space environment analogues. The ASIM Science data Centre (ASDC) is processing and distributing the ASIM data.</p>
